\title{Classification procedure for multi-label response based on a multinomial 
model,  solved by a combination of the multinomial Ridge Iteratively 
Reweighted Least Squares (multinom-RIRLS) algorithm and 
the Adaptive Sparse PLS (SPLS) regression}
\usage{
multinom.spls(Xtrain, Ytrain, lambda.ridge, lambda.l1, ncomp, Xtest = NULL,
  adapt = TRUE, maxIter = 100, svd.decompose = TRUE, center.X = TRUE,
  scale.X = FALSE, weighted.center = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Xtrain}{a (ntrain x p) data matrix of predictor values. 
\code{Xtrain} must be a matrix. Each row corresponds to an observation 
and each column to a predictor variable.}

\item{Ytrain}{a (ntrain) vector of (continuous) responses. \code{Ytrain} 
must be a vector or a one column matrix, and contains the response variable 
for each observation. \code{Ytrain} should take values in 
\{0,...,nclass-1\}, where nclass is the number of class.}

\item{lambda.ridge}{a positive real value. \code{lambda.ridge} is the Ridge 
regularization parameter for the RIRLS algorithm (see details).}

\item{lambda.l1}{a positive real value, in [0,1]. \code{lambda.l1} is the 
sparse penalty parameter for the dimension reduction step by sparse PLS 
(see details).}

\item{ncomp}{a positive integer. \code{ncomp} is the number of 
PLS components. If \code{ncomp=0},then the Ridge regression is performed 
without any dimension reduction (no SPLS step).}

\item{adapt}{a boolean value, indicating whether the sparse PLS selection 
step sould be adaptive or not (see details).}

\item{maxIter}{a positive integer. \code{maxIter} is the maximal number of 
iterations in the Newton-Raphson parts in the RIRLS algorithm (see details).}

\item{svd.decompose}{a boolean parameter. \code{svd.decompose} indicates 
wether or not the predictor matrix \code{Xtrain} should be decomposed by 
SVD (singular values decomposition) for the RIRLS step (see details).}

\item{center.X}{a boolean value indicating whether the data matrices 
\code{Xtrain} and \code{Xtest} (if provided) should be centered or not.}

\item{scale.X}{a boolean value indicating whether the data matrices 
\code{Xtrain} and \code{Xtest} (if provided) should be scaled or not 
(\code{scale.X=TRUE} implies \code{center.X=TRUE}) in the spls step.}

\item{weighted.center}{a boolean value indicating whether the centering 
should take into account the weighted l2 metric or not in the SPLS step.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{multinom.spls} with the following attributes
\item{Coefficients}{a (p+1) x (nclass-1) matrix containing the linear 
coefficients associated to the predictors and intercept in the multinomial 
model 
explaining the response Y.}
\item{hatY}{the (ntrain) vector containing the estimated response value on 
the train set \code{Xtrain}.}
\item{hatYtest}{the (ntest) vector containing the predicted labels 
for the observations from \code{Xtest} (if provided).}
\item{DeletedCol}{the vector containing the indexes of columns with null 
variance in \code{Xtrain} that were skipped in the procedure.}
\item{A}{a list of size nclass-1 with predictors selected by the procedures 
for each set of coefficients in the multinomial model (i.e. indexes of the 
corresponding non null entries in each columns of \code{Coefficients}. Each 
elements of \code{A} is a subset of 1:p.}
\item{A.full}{union of elements in A, corresponding to predictors 
selected in the full model.}
\item{Anames}{Vector of selected predictor names, i.e. the names of the 
columns from \code{Xtrain} that are in \code{A.full}.}
\item{converged}{a \{0,1\} value indicating whether the RIRLS algorithm did
converge in less than \code{maxIter} iterations or not.}
\item{X.score}{list of nclass-1 different (n x ncomp) matrices being 
the observations coordinates or scores in the new component basis produced 
for each class in the multinomial model by the SPLS step (sparse PLS), 
see Durif et al. (2017) for details.}
\item{X.weight}{list of nclass-1 different (p x ncomp) matrices being 
the coefficients of predictors in each components produced for each class 
in the multinomial model by the sparse PLS, 
see Durif et al. (2017) for details.}
\item{X.score.full}{a ((n x (nclass-1)) x ncomp) matrix being the 
observations coordinates or scores in the new component basis produced 
by the SPLS step (sparse PLS) in the linearized multinomial model, see 
Durif et al. (2017). Each column t.k of \code{X.score} is a SPLS component.}
\item{X.weight.full}{a (p x ncomp) matrix being the coefficients of predictors 
in each components produced by sparse PLS in the linearized multinomial 
model, see Durif et al. (2017). Each column w.k of 
\code{X.weight} verifies t.k = Xtrain x w.k (as a matrix product).}
\item{lambda.ridge}{the Ridge hyper-parameter used to fit the model.}
\item{lambda.l1}{the sparse hyper-parameter used to fit the model.}
\item{ncomp}{the number of components used to fit the model.}
\item{V}{the (ntrain x ntrain) matrix used to weight the metric in the 
sparse PLS step. \code{V} is the inverse of the covariance matrix of the 
pseudo-response produced by the RIRLS step.}
\item{proba}{the (ntrain) vector of estimated probabilities for the 
observations in code \code{Xtrain}, that are used to estimate the 
\code{hatY} labels.}

new observations in \code{Xtest}, that are used to predict the 
\code{hatYtest} labels.}

\description{
The function \code{multinom.spls} performs compression and variable selection 
in the context of multi-label ('nclass' > 2) classification 
(with possible prediction) using Durif et al. (2017) algorithm 
based on Ridge IRLS and sparse PLS.
}
\details{
The columns of the data matrices \code{Xtrain} and \code{Xtest} may 
not be standardized, since standardizing can be performed by the function 
\code{multinom.spls} as a preliminary step.

The procedure described in Durif et al. (2017) is used to compute
latent sparse components that are used in a multinomial regression model.
In addition, when a matrix \code{Xtest} is supplied, the procedure 
predicts the response associated to these new values of the predictors.
